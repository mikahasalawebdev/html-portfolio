<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Mika and my dream job is a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>I'm a college student from Finland and I will graduate as IT engineer in summer of 2025.</p>

<p>This my first web page developed purely with HTML. I'm positive that I'll get a lot better at this soon.</p>
